Remaining work / To do

Completed (removed from active list):
- Cube implemented (`src/primitive_factory.*`).
- Selection implemented (`Scene::selectEntity`, `Scene::getSelectedId`, entity listing UI).
- Translation gizmo implemented (`Gizmo::translationWidget` and onscreen drag in `gizmo_draw.cpp`).
- ImGuizmo integrated and `GizmoController` added (`src/gizmo_controller.*`) — works with offscreen FBO and fallback.
- Transform gizmo (translate/rotate/scale) wired to scene transforms and undo/redo via `Scene::TransformCommand` push on manipulation end.
- UI controls for create/select/delete wired (Cube button, Delete button, entity list selection).
- Tools UI moved out of `main.cpp` to `src/tools_window.*` and pin helper moved to `src/ui_helpers.*`.
- Basic camera controls (orbit/pan/zoom) implemented and `Camera` integration present.

Active remaining tasks:
- Primitive factory: implement `sphere`, `cylinder`, `plane` in `src/primitive_factory.*`.

Recommendations / next steps:
- Remove temporary debug prints (e.g. in `src/gizmo_controller.cpp`).
- Compute mesh bounds and tighten `Renderer::drawSelectionBox` to use real mesh AABB.
- Extract other UI windows (Assets/Bottom/Viewport) into `src/ui/` files for clarity.
- Add a resource manager for shaders/textures and a small Undo/Command module if needed.
- Optionally add `animator.h`/`animator.cpp` skeleton for future animation work.

Refactor / Organization Plan (status)
- Step A (renderer): partially done — `Renderer` exists and is used from `main.cpp`.
- Step B (camera): camera code is present; consider moving more input handling into `camera.*`.
- Step C (gizmo_controller): implemented and working.
- Step D (animator): not yet implemented.

Notes:
- After finishing the primitive generators and any cleanup (debug prints, selection box), run a full build and smoke test.
- I can remove debug prints and make a cleanup commit; tell me if you want that done now.
