Remaining work / To do


Refactor / Organization Plan (status)
- Step A (renderer): partially done — `Renderer` exists and is used from `main.cpp` (some headers/sources added).
- Step B (camera): camera code is present; consider moving more input handling into `camera.*`.
- Step C (gizmo_controller): implemented and working.
- Step D (animator): not yet implemented.

Notes:
- Primitive generators (cube, sphere, cylinder, plane) are implemented in `src/primitive_factory.*`.
- After finishing any remaining cleanup (debug prints, selection box), run a full build and smoke test.
- I can remove debug prints and make a cleanup commit; tell me if you want that done now.
