RoadMap for NovaDCC

Snapshot — where we are now (trimmed)

- Project scaffold and build: `CMakeLists.txt` configured, vcpkg bootstrapped into `external/vcpkg`. Build system and runtime copying work.
- Prototype app and Editor core basics implemented (scene/entity, primitive factory, selection/gizmo, UI spawn/delete, orbit camera). These items were removed from the outstanding checklist and are implemented in the codebase.
- Remaining work focuses on polishing, UX, serialization, importers, and CI.

High-level project roadmap (remaining milestones / priorities)

Milestone 1 — Editor core & scene model (POLISH)
Remaining deliverables to finish:
- Harden Undo/Redo: ensure commands are pushed at correct boundaries (gizmo edits, create/delete) and add more command types.
- Selection/gizmo UX: snapping, local/global modes, numeric widget polish and consistent undo boundaries.
- Spawn placement improvements: raycast from mouse into scene/grid to place primitives where user clicks (currently spawns at world origin).

Milestone 2 — Asset pipeline & importers (NEXT)
Deliverables:
- Import OBJ / glTF (tinyobj/tinygltf)
- Asset browser UI, drag/drop preview
- Asset-to-scene instantiation

Milestone 3 — Rendering improvements
Deliverables:
- PBR shader path, directional lighting, environment maps
- Offscreen framebuffer for viewport, MSAA, post-process (exposure/gamma)

Milestone 4 — Editor UX & tools
Deliverables:
- Scene hierarchy panel, inspector panel (material/mesh/transform)
- Undo/Redo completion, copy/paste
- Transform gizmo improvements (snap/local/global)

Milestone 5 — Serialization, export & plugins
Deliverables:
- Scene save/load (JSON/binary)
- Exporters (glTF), plugin API (simple)

Milestone 6 — CI, packaging & multi-platform
Deliverables:
- CI pipeline (Windows x86/x64, Linux, macOS)
- Automated packaging (zip / installer)
- Release process and versioning

Milestone 7 — Polishing, tests & docs
Deliverables:
- Unit tests for core systems
- Integration tests (build/run)
- Clean Doxygen/README and developer guide

Immediate priorities (what to do next)
1) Harden Undo/Redo and push command boundaries (high priority for editor correctness).
2) Implement spawn raycast placement (map click -> world position) so spawn places at user-selected point rather than origin.
3) Improve gizmo UX (snap, local/global toggle) and numeric field behavior.
4) Add asset import (tinygltf) and wire asset-to-scene instantiation.
5) Add CI template for Win32 builds using vcpkg (to stabilize tooling).

How we should proceed (short)
- Work in small focused branches (e.g. `feature/undo-system`, `feature/spawn-raycast`).
- Prioritize correctness (undo/gizmo) before adding features (importers, PBR).

Test plan for immediate changes (Undo/Redo / spawn raycast)
- Build debug configuration.
- Run app, create primitives, manipulate with gizmo, verify undo/redo behavior matches expectations and that no-empty undo entries are created.
- Click in viewport to spawn (after raycast implemented) and verify object appears at clicked world position and is selectable.
