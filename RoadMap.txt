RoadMap for NovaDCC

Snapshot — where we are now (status)

- Project scaffold and build: `CMakeLists.txt` configured, vcpkg bootstrapped into `external/vcpkg`, configured for x86 (Win32). `NovaDCC.exe` builds successfully.
- Runtime: post-build DLL copying added (or available) so executable runs without manual DLL movement.
- Prototype app (`src/main.cpp`): ImGui dockspace, viewport, grid, cube, orbit camera — runs on Win32.
- Tooling: vcpkg used for dependencies (`glfw`, `glad`, `imgui`, `glm`). Doxygen is present but `Doxyfile` has obsolete tags (warnings).
- Macro warnings fixed by defining ImGui loader to GLAD.

High-level project roadmap (milestones)

Milestone 0 — Prototype (COMPLETE)
Deliverable: runnable NovaDCC prototype (ImGui + viewport + cube)

Milestone 1 — Editor core & scene model (Next priority)
Deliverables:
- Scene/Entity system (scene graph or flat entity list)
- Primitive factory (cube/sphere/cylinder/plane)
- Selection, transform gizmo (translate/rotate/scale)
- UI controls wired to create/select/delete objects
- Basic camera controls (orbit/pan/zoom) robust
Why: makes UI meaningful — clicking “Cube” spawns objects you can manipulate

Milestone 2 — Asset pipeline & importers
Deliverables:
- Import OBJ / glTF (tinyobj/tinygltf)
- Asset browser UI, drag/drop preview
- Asset-to-scene instantiation
Why: real assets allow real editing workflows

Milestone 3 — Rendering improvements
Deliverables:
- PBR shader path, directional lighting, environment maps
- Offscreen framebuffer for viewport, MSAA, post-process (exposure/gamma)
Why: better visuals for real asset inspection

Milestone 4 — Editor UX & tools
Deliverables:
- Transform gizmo improvements (snap, local/global)
- Scene hierarchy panel, inspector panel (material/mesh/transform)
- Undo/Redo, copy/paste
Why: basic editor UX; makes the tool usable for iterative editing

Milestone 5 — Serialization, export & plugins
Deliverables:
- Scene save/load (JSON/binary)
- Exporters (glTF), plugin API (simple)
Why: persistence and interop with other tools

Milestone 6 — CI, packaging & multi-platform
Deliverables:
- CI pipeline (Windows x86, Windows x64, Linux, macOS)
- Automated packaging (zip / installer)
- Release process and versioning
Why: reproducible builds and distribution

Milestone 7 — Polishing, tests & docs
Deliverables:
- Unit tests for core systems
- Integration tests (build/run)
- Clean Doxygen/README and user guide
Why: maintainability and onboarding

Rough effort estimates (rough, per milestone)

- M1 (Editor core): 1–3 weeks (small team / single dev)
- M2 (Importers): 1–2 weeks
- M3 (Renderer): 2–4 weeks
- M4 (UX/tools): 2–3 weeks
- M5 (Serialization/plugins): 1–2 weeks
- M6 (CI/packaging): 1–2 weeks
- M7 (Polish & docs): ongoing, 1–2 weeks major push

Top recommendations — prioritized (what to do next)

1) (Highest) Implement Scene/Entity + Primitive Factory + wire “Cube” button
- Why: turns UI into interactive editor; unlocks higher level features.
- Quick win: create `src/scene.h`/`src/scene.cpp`, `src/primitive_factory.h`/`src/primitive_factory.cpp`, update `src/main.cpp` to show objects and selection.
- I can generate these files and CMake edits now.

2) Stabilize build/runtime automation & CI basics
- Ensure the Win32 build is reproducible, add a small GitHub Actions template for Windows x86 build using vcpkg toolchain.
- Add post-build copy of runtime DLLs (already present — verify).
- Why: avoids “works on my machine” delays and makes builds repeatable.

3) Add Undo/Redo skeleton and selection/gizmo basics
- Even a simple command stack (push operations) will pay off when making editing actions reversible.

4) Add Asset import (OBJ/glTF) using vcpkg tinyobj/tinygltf
- Wire an "Import" dialog in the Assets panel that loads a mesh and creates an instance.

5) Tidy documentation and tooling
- Fix Doxyfile (run `doxygen -u Doxyfile` or remove obsolete tags) and add a README with build/run dev steps for Win32.
- Add a small `CONTRIBUTING.md` and dev setup checklist (Visual Studio components, vcpkg steps).

6) Improve renderer (PBR) and add frame capture / screenshot
- After scene and import are working; improves usability for artists.

7) Cross-platform testing and packaging
- Add CI on Windows/Linux/macOS to validate cross-platform portability.

Immediate actionable steps (do these now)

Primary path (Scene + primitive button):
- Add files: `src/scene.h`, `src/scene.cpp`, `src/primitive_factory.h`, `src/primitive_factory.cpp`.
- Update `src/main.cpp` to include the scene and to spawn a cube when the “Cube” ImGui button is pressed.
- Edit `CMakeLists.txt` to include the new sources.
- Provide a test plan to validate (build & run, press Cube, select object, move).

Tooling-first path (stabilize tooling):
- Fix Doxygen warnings: run in `docs` folder: `doxygen -u Doxyfile` OR run PowerShell to remove obsolete tags.
- Add small GitHub Actions file (I can produce) that checks out code, bootstraps vcpkg, installs the x86 triplet ports, configures & builds.

How I recommend you prioritize (short summary)

- Scene + primitives + selection/gizmo (M1) — makes the editor actually useful.
- Add Undo/Redo + basic serialization skeleton — avoids data loss and enables iterative development.
- Asset import (M2) — get real models into the scene.
- Renderer improvements (M3) — once assets are importable, visuals matter.
- CI, packaging, docs (M6/M7) — make the project reproducible and shareable.

Git & workflow suggestions

- Create branch: `feature/scene-system` and open small PRs per focused change.
- Use small commits and descriptive PR titles (e.g., "feat(scene): add scene and primitive factory").
- Tag milestones in issues: create GitHub issues for each milestone task, break into subtasks.

Next explicit actions — choose one:
A) Generate the scene + primitive factory files and CMake updates now (I’ll produce the exact contents and file blocks),
B) Produce a GitHub Actions CI workflow to validate Win32 x86 builds using vcpkg, or
C) Update the Doxyfile and README for dev setup

Please reply with A, B or C to proceed.
